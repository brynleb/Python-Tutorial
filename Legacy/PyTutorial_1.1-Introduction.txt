PyTutorial 1.1 - Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that has now become the language of choice in many
fields of science. This is largely due to its ease of programming and readability, the large
number of libraries and community support, and the variety of programming environments (e.g. command line interpreters,
scripts, web-based interpreters, notebooks). This tutorial is a crash course in Python designed to give you an overview
of the programming essentials, as well as some useful tools for scientific computing, data processing, and visualization.

Although a variety of web browser-based Python development environments exist, there are significant advantages
to installing Python locally on your computer. This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to install 
and configure Python from source, as well as how to install third-party libraries that are essential for data science.

The majority of the modules in this tutorial are written in Jupyter Notebook -- a web-based interactive
development environment (IDE) for writing code (e.g. Python, Markdown, LateX, etc.) and displaying graphics.
It uses a notebook format similar to Wolfram Mathematica or Windows OneNote, where interactive cells can be
executed one at a time by a kernel (a centralized "computational engine"). While the kernel is running, all the
data generated by the code is stored temporarily in the RAM of your computer---allowing users to access data generated in
previous cells.

Jupyter Notebooks can be run for your web browser, so no installation is required. However, it is highly recommended
to install and use Visual Studio (VS) Code to work through this tutorial. This IDE integrates the three most common 
Python environments (command line, scripts, and notebooks), allowings users to write and execute code from any one.

Installing the latest version of Python (3.10) for Windows:

- Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- Click on "Latest Python 3 Release"
- Scroll down to "Files"
- Select the "Windows Installer" corresponding to your operating system type (32-bit) or (64-bit)
  (To check your operating system type, click the Start menu, select Settings -> System -> About. It should be listed under "System type".)
- Once the Installer has downloaded, run the .exe file (usually located in your Downloads folder)
- In the Python Installer Setup window, click on the checkbox "Add Python 3.X to PATH" at the bottom.
  This will add the location of the Python.exe to your system's PATH environment variable so you can run python from the command prompt.
- Next, click "Install Now" to install Python. Choose the default setting for any remaining setup options.
- Once Python has finished installing, click on the Start Menu, type cmd, and open a command prompt by selecting cmd.exe.
- To verify Python installed correctly, type "python --version" + Enter.
  "Python 3.10.XX" should appear.

Installing the latest version of Python (3.10) for MAC:

- MACs usually come preinstalled with Python version 2.
- To check which version you have, open a terminal and type "python --version" + Enter.
- For this course, we will be using the latest version of Python 3 (3.10)

- Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/
- Click on "Latest Python 3 Release"
- Scroll down to "Files"
- Select the "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer" for macOS 10.9 and later
- Once the Installer has downloaded, run the .pkg file. Choose the default setup options.
- Upon completion, the installer will create a "Python 3.10" directory in your applications folder.
- To verify Python installed correctly, open a new terminal and type "python3 --version" + Enter.
  "Python 3.10.XX" should appear.
- Note that you must use the "python3" command to access Python 3.10 from the command prompt.
  The command "python" will default to Python 2 unless you create an alias.

Running Python from the command prompt

- From the command prompt, type "python" and hit Enter. You should see something like the following:

Python 3.10.4 (tags/v3.10.4:9d38120, Mar 23 2022, 23:13:41) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

- This is an interactive prompt. It allows us to write one line of Python at a time.
- To create a Hello World application, we can simply write 'print("hello world!")' + Enter:

>>> print("hello world!")
hello world!

- We can also do simple calculations with integers and floats:

>>> 1+2 - 2*3
-3

>>> 4/3
1.3333333333333333

- Or we can define variables:

>>> x=10
>>> y=2
>>> print(x**y)
100

- To exit out of Python and return to the command prompt, type "exit()"

>>> exit()

Installing VS Code

- Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Click on the down arrow next to the 'Download for Windows' button
- Download the installer appropriate for your operating system
- Follow the default installation instructions
- Next, open VS Code and install the Python extension:
  - Click on the Extensions icon on the left sidebar or type 'Ctrl + Shift + X'
  - Type 'python' into the search bar and select the first result 'Python'
    This extension that includes Intellisense (PyLance), Linting, Debugging, Jupyter Notebooks, and more.
- You are now ready to open Python files (.py) or Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) and start writing code.
- To run a Python file, open it and click on the 'Run Code' button in the top right corner
  (or type 'Ctrl + Alt + N')
- When running for the first time, you may be asked to select a Python interpreter:
  - Open the command palette by typing 'Ctrl + Shift + P' and type 'Python: Select Interpreter'
  - You can also select the Python Environment Option on the bottom right corner of the status bar
  - The command presents a list of available interpreters that VS Code finds automatically on your system,
    select the most recent version of Python that you just installed.
